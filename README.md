# Brian Cole - Project and Portfolio IV

## Milestone 1 - Preproduction Presentation

# Overview

For this project I decided to create a fitness application. This fitness application will be pulling data from an API called [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/) which is hosted on RapidAPI.com. This project will have the ability to create a workout plan, add a workout regiment, and sort through workouts based on muscle groups

## Milestone 2 - Early Development

This week will be the first iteration of the project. The primary goal of this would be making sure the application is functional on the development side. In addition, the goal will be choosing a tech stack. This application will be built using React with NextJS and the CSS framework of choice will be done using Bootstrap. On the design process, the goal of this week will be transitioning wireframes into high quality design mockups. Right now this is the current iteration of this [project](https://xd.adobe.com/view/4ff8a799-a854-4bf4-9b67-6a127f7d8a20-1aab/).

## Milestone 3 - Continue Development 

this week will be continuing on the month long project. The primary goal for this would be looking into the Exercise api documentation on having the application hace crud functionality. In addition, the application is still being built using Next JS. This week will be debugging the application and finalizing any performace issues.

## Milestone 4 - Deployment 

This final week will be finalizing the project for deployment. The hosting platform othat being chosen for this is Vercel, a hosting platform for hosting Next JS projects. This week we finalized the project and getting it ready for deployment.
