# Brian Cole - Project and Portfolio IV

## Milestone 1 - Preproduction Presentation

# Overview

For this project I decided to create a fitness application. This fitness application will be pulling data from an API called [ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb/) which is hosted on RapidAPI.com. This project will have the ability to create a workout plan, add a workout regiment, and sort through workouts based on muscle groups

## Milestone 2 - Early Development

This week will be the first iteration of the project. The primary goal of this would be making sure the application is functional on the development side. In addition, the goal will be choosing a tech stack. This application will be built using React with NextJS and the CSS framework of choice will be done using Bootstrap. On the design process, the goal of this week will be transitioning wireframes into high quality design mockups. Right now this is the current iteration of this [project](https://xd.adobe.com/view/4ff8a799-a854-4bf4-9b67-6a127f7d8a20-1aab/).
